# [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)
The Twelve-Factor App methodology is a set of best practices for building modern, scalable web applications that are suitable for cloud environments. 
It emphasizes principles such as codebase management, dependency isolation, configuration through environment variables, and treating backing services as attached resources. 
The methodology promotes a strict separation of concerns, enabling applications to be easily deployable, maintainable, and scalable, while ensuring that they can operate consistently across various environments. 
Following these principles helps teams build robust applications that can efficiently adapt to changing requirements.

1. Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control: There should be a single codebase for the application, which is tracked in a version control system (e.g., Git). This codebase can be deployed to multiple environments (development, staging, production).

2. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies: Applications should explicitly declare all dependencies using a dependency management tool (e.g., requirements.txt for Python, package.json for Node.js). This ensures that the application can run in isolation, regardless of the environment.

3. Config
Store configuration in the environment: Configuration settings (like database credentials and API keys) should be stored in environment variables, separating them from the code. This makes it easier to change configuration without modifying the codebase.
4. Backing Services
Treat backing services as attached resources: All services that an application relies on (databases, message queues, caching systems) should be treated as resources that can be attached or detached. This allows for greater flexibility and easier integration with different services.
5. Build, Release, Run
Strictly separate the build and run stages: The process of building an application (compiling code, packaging dependencies) should be distinct from its release (deploying to a server) and run stages (executing the application). This ensures that the application can be built once and run consistently.
6. Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes: Applications should be designed to run in stateless processes, meaning they do not rely on local state. Any state information should be stored in a backing service like a database, enabling easier scaling and recovery.
7. Port Binding
Export services via port binding: Applications should be self-contained and expose services over a port. This allows the application to run independently and be accessible through HTTP or other protocols.
8. Concurrency
Scale out via the process model: Applications should be able to scale horizontally by adding more processes. This can be achieved through process management tools that allow for running multiple instances of an application.
9. Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown: Applications should be designed to start up quickly and shut down gracefully, allowing for rapid deployment and recovery from failures.
10. Dev/Prod Parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible: The development environment should closely resemble the production environment to minimize issues related to differences in configuration, dependencies, and services.
11. Logs
Treat logs as event streams: Applications should not manage their own log files. Instead, logs should be treated as streams of events, which can be routed to various logging services or tools for analysis.
12. Admin Processes
Run administrative/management tasks as one-off processes: Any administrative tasks (like database migrations) should be executed as one-off processes within the same environment as the application, ensuring consistency.
Conclusion
Following the Twelve-Factor App methodology helps developers create applications that are easy to maintain, scale, and deploy in cloud environments. It fosters best practices in software development, ultimately leading to more robust and resilient applications.
